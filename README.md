# Drone-Detection-using-YOLO-Algorithms
This project is focused on the object detection implementation using YOLOv3 and v5 algorithms to detect drones in images. 
Images from the COCO dataset were used to train the models and bird images were added to create an augmented dataset to check for the working of the models.
Please refer to [ProjectReport.pdf](https://github.com/AmoghJuloori/Drone-Detection-using-YOLO-Algorithms/blob/main/ProjectReport.pdf) for a detailed report on the project.
